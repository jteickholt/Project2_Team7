### Team Members:  Ruby Mittal, Luis Santana, Jeff Eickholt

### Project Title: Do you want to relocate to ...?

#### In this project, we will be creating an application that will allow users to view details of a state or city to decide if they want to move there.  This app will contain two dashoards.  The first will be for a particular State of City that the user chooses.  It will display some key statitics and chart about the city.  The second dashboard will allow the user to choose two states or cities and see a side by side comparison the the same key statistic and charts. This will allow them to compare the current state/city that they live in to anothre  state/city that they are thinking of moving to.

####  The main dataset will be the US Census Data American Community Data (link below).  We will also be attempting to gather temperature data from the National Centers for Environmental Education (second link below).  We haven't yet determined if we can figure out the weather API.  If we can't figure this out in the next couple of days, we will drop this data source and replace the chart with a different chart based on census data.

#### The final output will look very similar to the Dashboard_Preview Power Point included in the repo.
